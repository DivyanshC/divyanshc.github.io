# Using Jekyll: The Static Site Generator to build our website

## Install Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev git
```

## Install Jekyll `bundler`

```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
```

## Creating a site based on Chirpy Starter Theme

Visit https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy#quick-start for step by step instructions or click on [Chirpy Starter](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter/generate) on their page to automate the flow.

**Repo name should be \<YOUR-USER-NAME>.github.io**

After creating a site (forking repo) based on the template, clone your repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone git@<YOUR-USER-NAME>/<YOUR-REPO-NAME>.git
```

then install your dependencies:

```bash
cd repo-name
bundle
```

## Make changes in \_config.yml file

```yaml
timezone: Asia/Kolkata
title: HomeLab Docs
tagline: A Doc site for my homelab
description: A Doc site for my homelab.
url: "https://divyanshc.github.io/"
theme_mode: dark
avatar: <URL-of-Profile-Photo>
```

## Adding a new post to your site:

create a new file in the `_posts` directory.

File name should be in the format of `YYYY-MM-DD-TITLE-OF-POST.md`

Image from asset:

```markdown
... which is shown in the screenshot below:
![A screenshot](/assets/screenshot.jpg)
```

Linking to a file:

```markdown
... you can [download the PDF](/assets/diagram.pdf) here.
```

Check the [Jekyll Pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) for more information about Local Linking of Files (Assets).

All content should be in **markdown** format. Check [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for more information.

## Running the site locally and pushing to GitHub

Serving your site locally is as simple as running the following command:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll s
```

This will start the server on port 4000. http://127.0.0.1:4000/ will be your site.

### After making changes to your site, commit and push then up to git on **main** branch

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat(post): <POST-TITLE>"
git push origin main
```

This site already has github actions configured, this uses CI/CD to automatically get your site from the main branch by updating gh-pages branch.

Just push to the main branch and it will automatically build and deploy from the gh-pages branch.

Check the **Actions tab** on your repo for more information.

### Change these settings in repo settings

- Your repo should be set to `Public`
- Go to pages tab in repo settings and set `Source` to `gh-pages`, then click on `Save` (push on main branch only)
- Check Enforce HTTPS

Your site will be available at **https://\<YOUR-USER-NAME>.github.io/**

## Self Hoting the site

Building your site in production mode to get output to \_site folder to deploy it ourselves:

```bash
JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll b
```

### Using Docker

Create a `Dockerfile` with the following:

```dockerfile
FROM nginx:stable-alpine
COPY _site /usr/share/nginx/html
```

Build the image:

```bash
docker build .
```

Be sure to ‚≠ê the [jekyll repo](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) and the [Chrirpy theme repo](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy)
